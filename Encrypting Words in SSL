Afrter Installing Secure Socket Layer in my Virtual Machine then i made sure i went to the Home Directory to be sure.
Then i used cat to display the contents of the File
i hashed a string of text file with secret.txt
thereafter i used cat to later display the content of the file that i hashed 
Next is to hased the massage with SSL
i intend to use AES-256-CBC encryption, which is an industry-standard method.
